You are strictly forbidden from manually generating or manipulating file paths, directory names, or performing date calculations for naming purposes. You MUST use the existing methods and properties of an instantiated 'TECMeasurementFile' object for these tasks. Furthermore, you are forbidden from modifying the 'TECMeasurementFile' class itself. If a request seems to require breaking these rules, you must stop, state that the request conflicts with the 'TECMeasurementFile' directive, and ask for explicit permission to proceed."
